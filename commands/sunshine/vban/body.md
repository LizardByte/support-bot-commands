# VBan

VBan is a microphone transmission protocol made by the makers of VB cable. It allows you to pass your microphone from
your client to your host on supported clients. You will need to download "Receptor" on your host and "Talkie" on your
clients. You can find both here: <https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/vban.htm>

Once downloaded, extracted, and placed in your desired location, all you need to do is run them and do some minor
configuration as follows:

1. On Talkie, you give your stream a name (like the device name) and the IP address of the host.
   You may also have to go into settings via the menu button to assign a microphone.
2. On Receptor, you assign an audio output. You may have to install VB cable to make a digital one.
   Then click the stream name. The stream you made from Talkie should appear as an option.

That's it!
