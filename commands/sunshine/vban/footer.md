# Notes

- As Receptor does not auto-start as it is not an installed program, you may want to add it as a
  Sunshine pre-launch command. Receptor will remember the last audio stream it was connected to.
- You may have to configure Windows/Game audio setting on the host to use the Microphone if you are using VB cable.
- To use Vban over the internet, you will also have to manually forward UDP Port 6980.
